      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes the EcdsaSecp384r1Signature and
EcdsaSecp256r1Signature created in 2019 for the Data Integrity
[[DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification. It uses the RDF Dataset Canonicalization
Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-CANONICALIZATION]] to transform the input document into
its canonical form. It uses one of two mechanisms to digest and sign: SHA-256
[[RFC6234]] as the <a>message digest algorithm</a> and ECDSA with Curve P-256
defined in [[FIPS-186-4]] as the <a>signature algorithm</a>, or SHA-384
[[RFC6234]] as the <a>message digest algorithm</a> and ECDSA with Curve P-384
defined in [[FIPS-186-4]] as the <a>signature algorithm</a>.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
The following terms are used throughout this document:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a canonical form. This process is
sometimes also called <em>normalization</em>.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even one
bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to find two
different inputs for the same output.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message has not
been modified in transit and came from someone possessing a particular secret.
          </dd>
        </dl>

      <h2>Data Model</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a data model for a number of key formats and
signature formats.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Key Formats</h2>

        <p class="issue" title="Refer normatively to a Multikey specification">
This specification should not specify multikey formats. It should, instead,
point to a multikey registry and/or specification. Examples of these
sorts of documents include the DID Specification Registries for <a
href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#verification-method-types">
Verification Method Types</a>, the key types in the <a
href="https://ns.did.ai/suites/multikey-2021/v1/">
Multikey2021 JSON-LD Context</a>, and key definitions in the <a
href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocabulary</a>.
Ideally, the specification that this one points to would define all possible
multikeys listed in the <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv">Multicodec Registry</a>
and define how to encode them as multibase values in fields such as
`publicKeyMultibase` and `secretKeyMultibase`. The referenced specification
should also include an extensbility mechanism and registry for new values as
they are added to the Multicodec Registry.
        </p>

        <p>
The following two key formats are defined by this specification:
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>EcdsaSecp256r1VerificationKey2019</h3>
          <p>
A Curve P-256 compressed public key as defined in [[FIPS-186-4]]. The key MUST
contain a `type` set to `EcdsaSecp256r1VerificationKey2019`, `controller`, and
`publicKeyMultibase` value as defined by this specification.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>EcdsaSecp384r1VerificationKey2019</h3>
          <p>
A Curve P-384 compressed public key. The key MUST contain a `type` set to
`EcdsaSecp384r1VerificationKey2019`, `controller`, and `publicKeyMultibase`
value as defined by this specification.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Key Format Examples</h2>

          <p>

}

          <p class="issue"
            title="Avoid key format proliferation by using multikey header value">
The pattern that Data Integrity Verification Keys use presently leads to an
proliferation in key types and JSON-LD Contexts. This proliferation can be
avoided without any loss of the single-field precision benefits of a
multibase-encoded multicodec public key. The only downside for the approach
demonstrated below is the loss of human-readable key type information. It could
be argued that developers shouldn't be provided such affordances to ensure that
they do not meddle with the values. Software libraries would ensure that the
multicodec header information matches the expected header based on the
cryptosuite that is utilizing the key for verification. See the section on
<a href="#signature-format-examples"></a> for more information.

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> takes <var>tbs</var>, a

Perform the digital signature on <var>tbs</var> using the ECDSA digital
