This specification describes a Data Integrity Cryptosuite for use when
generating a digital signature using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm (ECDSA).

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a cryptographic suite for the purpose of creating,
and verifying proofs for ECDSA signatures in conformance with the
Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification. ECDSA signatures are
specified in [[FIPS-186-5]] with elliptic curves P-256 and P-384 specified in
[[NIST-SP-800-186]]. [[FIPS-186-5]] includes the <em>deterministic</em> ECDSA
algorithm which is also specified in [[RFC6979]].
      </p>
      <p>
This specification uses either the RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm 
[[RDF-CANON]] or the JSON Canonicalization Scheme [[RFC8785]] to transform the 
input document into its canonical form. It uses one of two mechanisms to digest 
and sign: SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the message digest algorithm and ECDSA with 
Curve P-256 as the signature algorithm, or SHA-384 [[RFC6234]] as the message 
digest algorithm and ECDSA with Curve P-384 as the signature algorithm.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
The elliptic curves P-256 and P-384 of [[NIST-SP-800-186]] are referred to as 
<em>secp256r1</em> and <em>secp384r1</em> respectively in [[SECG2]]. In 
addition, this notation is sometimes used in ECDSA software libraries.

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming proof</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification. Specifically,
all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#algorithms"></a>
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming proof</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.

        <p>
This document also contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content. Some
of these examples contain characters that are invalid JSON, such as inline
comments (`//`) and the use of ellipsis (`...`) to denote
information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON or
JSON-LD.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
for <a>verification methods</a> and <a>data integrity proof</a> formats.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Verification Methods</h3>
        <p>
The cryptographic material used to verify a <a>data integrity proof</a> is
called the <a>verification method</a>. This suite relies on public key material
represented using [[MULTIBASE]] and [[MULTICODEC]]. This suite supports public
key use for both digital signature generation and verification, according to
[[FIPS-186-5]].
        </p>

        <p>
This suite MAY be used to verify Data Integrity Proofs [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]
produced by ECDSA public key material encoded as a
<a href="#multikey">Multikey</a>. Loss-less key transformation processes that
result in equivalent cryptographic material MAY be utilized.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Multikey</h4>

          <p class="issue">
This definition should go in the Data Integrity specification and referenced
from there.
          </p>

          <p>
The `type` of the verification method MUST be `Multikey`.
          </p>

          <p>
The `controller` of the verification method MUST be a URL.
          </p>

          <p>
The `publicKeyMultibase` property of the verification method MUST be
a public key encoded according to [[MULTICODEC]] and formatted according to
[[MULTIBASE]]. The multicodec encoding of a P-256 public key is the
two-byte prefix `0x1200` followed by the 33-byte compressed public key data.
The 35 byte value is then encoded using base58-btc (`z`) as the prefix.
The multicodec encoding of a P-384 public key is the
two-byte prefix `0x1201` followed by the 49-byte compressed public key data.
The 51 byte value is then encoded using base58-btc (`z`) as the prefix.
Any other encodings MUST NOT be allowed.
          </p>

          <p class="advisement">
Developers are advised to not accidentally publish a representation of a private
key. Implementations of this specification will raise errors in the event of a
[[MULTICODEC]] value other than `0x1200` or `0x1201` being used in a
`publicKeyMultibase` value.

        <p class="issue" title="Refer normatively to a Multikey specification">
This specification should not specify multikey formats. It should, instead,
point to a multikey registry and/or specification. Examples of these
sorts of documents include the DID Specification Registries for <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#verification-method-types">
Verification Method Types</a>, the key types in the <a
href="https://ns.did.ai/suites/multikey-2021/v1/">
Multikey2021 JSON-LD Context</a>, and key definitions in the <a
href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocabulary</a>.
Ideally, the specification that this one points to would define all possible
multikeys listed in the <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv">Multicodec Registry</a>
and define how to encode them as multibase values in fields such as
`publicKeyMultibase` and `secretKeyMultibase`. The referenced specification
should also include an extensibility mechanism and registry for new values as
they are added to the Multicodec Registry.

          <h4>DataIntegrityProof</h4>

          <p>
The `verificationMethod` property of the proof MUST be a URL.
Dereferencing the `verificationMethod` MUST result in an object
containing a `type` property with the value set to
`Multikey`.
          </p>

          <p>
The `type` property of the proof MUST be `DataIntegrityProof`.

formatted date string.
          </p>
          <p>
The `proofPurpose` property of the proof MUST be a string, and MUST
match the verification relationship expressed by the verification method
`controller`.
          </p>
          <p>
The `proofValue` property of the proof MUST be a detached ECDSA

          <h4>Transformation (ecdsa-2019)</h4>

          <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to transform an unsecured input document
into a transformed document that is ready to be provided as input to the
hashing algorithm in Section <a href="#hashing-ecdsa-2019"></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
Required inputs to this algorithm are an
<a data-cite="vc-data-integrity#dfn-unsecured-data-document">
unsecured data document</a> (<var>unsecuredDocument</var>) and
transformation options (<var>options</var>). The
transformation options MUST contain a type identifier for the

        <h3>Split Key Formats From Cryptosuites</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Ensuring that cryptographic suites are versioned and tightly scoped to a very
small set of possible key types and signature schemes (ideally one key type and
size and one signature output type) is a design goal for most Data Integrity
cryptographic suites. Historically, this has been done by defining both the
key type and the cryptographic suite that uses the key type in the same
specification. The downside of doing so, however, is that there might be a
proliferation of different key types in multikey that result in different
cryptosuites defining the same key material differently. For example, one
cryptosuite might use compressed Curve P-256 keys while another uses
uncompressed values. If that occurs, it will harm interoperability. It will be
important in the coming months to years to ensure that this does not happen
by fully defining the multikey format in a separate specification so
cryptosuite specifications, such as this one, can refer to the multikey
specification, thus reducing the chances of multikey type proliferation and
improving the chances of maximum interoperability for the multikey format.
