      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a cryptographic suite for the purpose of creating,
and verifying proofs for ECDSA signatures in conformance with the
Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification. ECDSA signatures are
specified in [[FIPS-186-5]] with elliptic curves P-256 and P-384 specified in
[[NIST-SP-800-186]]. [[FIPS-186-5]] includes the <em>deterministic</em> ECDSA
algorithm which is also specified in [[RFC6979]].
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
The elliptic curves P-256 and P-384 of [[NIST-SP-800-186]] are respectively referred
to as <em>secp256r1</em> and <em>secp384r1</em> in [[SECG2]]. This notation is
sometimes also used by ECDSA software libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
Developers are cautioned to not confuse <em>secp256<b>r</b>1</em> terms with
<em>secp256<b>k</b>1</em> terms; the latter are from a third, <em>different</em>,
elliptic curve, that is not used by this specification. ECDSA software libraries
might not implement all of these curves, so developers need to take care when
choosing an ECDSA software library for their implementation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
This specification uses either the RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm
[[RDF-CANON]] or the JSON Canonicalization Scheme [[RFC8785]] to transform the
input document into its canonical form. It uses one of two mechanisms to digest
and sign: SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the message digest algorithm and ECDSA with
Curve P-256 as the signature algorithm, or SHA-384 [[RFC6234]] as the message
digest algorithm and ECDSA with Curve P-384 as the signature algorithm.

        <h3>Terminology</h3>

        <p>
Terminology used throughout this document is defined in the
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#terminology">Terminology</a> section of the
[[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] specification.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming proof</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification. Specifically,
all relevant normative statements in Sections
[[[#data-model]]] and [[[#algorithms]]]
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
[=conforming proof=]. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>
	<p>
This document contains examples of JSON and JSON-LD data. Some of these examples
are invalid JSON, as they include features such as inline comments (`//`)
explaining certain portions and ellipses (`...`) indicating the omission of
information that is irrelevant to the example. Such parts need to be
removed if implementers want to treat the examples as valid JSON or JSON-LD.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
to express verification methods, such as cryptographic public keys, and
data integrity proofs, such as digital signatures.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Verification Methods</h3>

        <p>
These verification methods are used to verify Data Integrity Proofs
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] produced using Elliptic Curve cryptographic key material
that is compliant with [[FIPS-186-5]]. The encoding formats for these key types
are provided in this section. Lossless cryptographic key transformation
processes that result in equivalent cryptographic key material MAY be used
during the processing of digital signatures.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Multikey</h4>

          <p>
The <a data-cite="CID#Multikey">Multikey format</a>, defined in
[[[CID]]], is used to express public keys for the cryptographic
suites defined in this specification.
          </p>

          <p>
The `publicKeyMultibase` property represents a Multibase-encoded Multikey
expression of a P-256 or P-384 public key.
          </p>

          <p>
The `publicKeyMultibase` value of the verification method MUST start with the
base-58-btc prefix (`z`), as defined in the
<a data-cite="CID#multibase-0">Multibase section</a> of
[[[CID]]]. A Multibase-encoded ECDSA 256-bit public key value or
an ECDSA 384-bit public key value follows, as defined in the
<a data-cite="CID#Multikey">Multikey section</a> of
[[[CID]]]. Any other encoding MUST NOT be allowed.
          </p>

          <p class="advisement">
Developers are advised to not accidentally publish a representation of a private
key. Implementations of this specification will raise errors in the event of a
Multicodec value other than `0x1200` or `0x1201` being used in a
`publicKeyMultibase` value.

The `secretKeyMultibase` property represents a Multibase-encoded Multikey
expression of a P-256 or P-384 secret key (also sometimes referred to as a
private key).

          </p>


          <p class="advisement">
            Developers are advised to prevent accidental publication of a representation of a secret
            key, and to not export the `secretKeyMultibase` property by default, when serializing

of [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] with the following restrictions.
          </p>

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The following section describes multiple Data Integrity cryptographic suites
that utilize the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
[[FIPS-186-5]]. When generating ECDSA signatures, the signature value MUST be
expressed according to section 7 of [[RFC4754]] (sometimes referred to as the
IEEE P1363 format) and encoded according to the specific cryptosuite proof
generation algorithm. All ECDSA signatures SHOULD use the <em>deterministic</em>
variant of the algorithm defined in [[FIPS-186-5]].
      </p>

      <p>
Implementations SHOULD fetch and cache verification method information as
early as possible when adding or verifying proofs. Parameters passed to
functions in this section use information from the verification method
&mdash; such as the public key size &mdash; to determine function parameters
&mdash; such as the cryptographic hashing algorithm.
      </p>

      <p id="canon-and-hash">
When the RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm (RDFC-1.0)Â [[RDF-CANON]] is used
with ECDSA algorithms, the cryptographic hashing function used by RDFC-1.0 is
chosen based on the size of the associated public key. For P-256 keys, the
default hashing function, SHA-2 with 256 bits of output, MUST be used. For P-384
keys, SHA-2 with 384-bits of output MUST be used, specified via the RDFC-1.0
<a data-cite="RDF-CANON#dfn-hash-algorithm">implementation-specific parameter</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
When the RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm [[RDF-CANON]] is used,
implementations of that algorithm will detect
<a data-cite="RDF-CANON#dataset-poisoning">dataset poisoning</a>
by default, and abort processing upon detection.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Instantiate Cryptosuite</h3>

        <p>
This algorithm is used to configure a cryptographic suite to be used by the
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#add-proof">Add Proof</a> and
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#verify-proof">Verify Proof</a>
functions in [[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]]. The algorithm takes an options object
([=map=] |options|) as input and returns a [=data integrity cryptographic suite
instance|cryptosuite instance=] ([=struct=] |cryptosuite|).
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Initialize |cryptosuite| to an empty [=struct=].
          </li>
          <li>
If |options|.|type| does not equal `DataIntegrityProof`, return |cryptosuite|.
          </li>

          <p>
The following algorithm replaces all blank node identifiers in a compact
JSON-LD document with custom-scheme URNs. The required inputs are a compact
JSON-LD document (|document|) and a custom URN scheme
(|urnScheme|) which defaults to "custom-scheme:". The |document| is assumed to
use only one
<em>@context</em> property at the top level of the document. Any additional
custom options (such as a document loader) can also be passed. It produces both
an expanded form of the skolemized JSON-LD document
(|skolemizedExpandedDocument| and a compact form of the skolemized
JSON-LD document (|skolemizedCompactDocument|) as output. The
skolemization used in this operation is intended to be reversible through the
use of the algorithm in Section [[[#todeskolemizednquads]]] which uses the
same custom URN scheme (|urnScheme|).

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p class="advisement">
Before reading this section, readers are urged to familiarize themselves
with general security advice provided in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#security-considerations">
Security Considerations section of the Data Integrity specification</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The integrity and authenticity of a secured document that is protected by
this cryptographic suite is dependent on a number of factors including
the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
correct application of a digital signature to the document
        </li>
        <li>
choice of an appropriate signature algorithm (ECDSA) and its parameters
(P-256, P-384)
        </li>
        <li>
correct implementation and usage of the digital signature algorithm,
particularly with respect to well-known problem areas
        </li>
        <li>
proper management of the private and public keys used for
signing and verification
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
In the following sections, we review these important points and direct
the reader to additional information.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Choice of ECDSA and Parameters</h3>
        <p>
The ECDSA signature scheme has the <strong>EUF-CMA</strong>
(<em>existential unforgeability under chosen message attacks</em>) security
property. This property guarantees that any efficient adversary who has the
public key <em>pk</em> of the signer and received an arbitrary number of
signatures on messages of its choice (in an adaptive manner) cannot output a
valid signature for a new message (except with negligible probability).
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>SUF-CMA</strong> (<em>strong unforgeability under chosen
message attacks</em>) is a stronger notion than <em>EUF-CMA</em>. It guarantees
that for any efficient adversary who has the public key <em>pk</em> of the
signer and received an arbitrary number of signatures on messages of its
choice, it cannot output a new valid signature pair for a new message
nor a new signature for an old message (except with negligible probability).
 ECDSA signature scheme does <strong>not</strong> have the SUF-CMA property,
 while other schemes such as EdDSA [[FIPS-186-5]] do.
        </p>
        <p>
Per [[NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1]] in the absence of large scale quantum
computers a <em>security strength</em> level of 128 bits requires a key size
of approximately 256 bits while a security strength level of 192 bits requires
a key size of 384 bits. [[NIST-SP-800-186]] recommendations includes curves
P-256 and P-384 at these respective security strength levels.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Implementation Considerations for ECDSA Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
The ECDSA algorithm as detailed in [[FIPS-186-5]] states: &quot;A
new secret random number <em>k</em>, 0 < <em>k</em> < <em>n</em>,
<strong>shall</strong> be generated prior to the generation
of each digital signature for use during the signature generation process.&quot;
The failure to properly generate this <em>k</em> value has lead to some highly
publicized integrity breaches in widely deployed systems. To counter this problem,
a hash-based method of determining the secret number <em>k</em>, called
<em>deterministic ECDSA</em>, is given in [[FIPS-186-5]] and [[RFC6979]].
        </p>
        <p>
Verification of a ECDSA signature is independent of the method of generating
<em>k</em>. Hence it is generally recommended to use <em>deterministic
ECDSA</em> unless other requirements dictate otherwise. For example, using
different <em>k</em> values results in different signature values for the same
document which might be a desirable property in some privacy enhancing situations.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Key Management</h3>
        <p>
The security of the ECDSA algorithm is dependent on the quality and
protection of its <em>private signing key</em>. Guidance in the management of
cryptographic keys is a large subject and the reader is referred to
[[NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1]] for more extensive recommendations and discussion.
As strongly recommended in both [[FIPS-186-5]] and [[NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1]], an ECDSA
private signing key is not to be used for any other purpose
than ECDSA signatures.
        </p>
        <p>
ECDSA private signing keys and <em>public verification keys</em> are strongly
advised to have limited <em>cryptoperiods</em> [[NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1]], where
a <em>cryptoperiod</em> is &quot;the time span during which a specific key is
authorized for use by legitimate entities or the keys for a given system will
remain in effect.&quot; [[NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1]] gives extensive
guidance on cryptoperiods for different key types under different situations
and generally recommends a 1-3 year cryptoperiod for a private signing key.
        </p>
        <p>
To deal with potential private key compromises, [[NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1]]
gives recommendations for protective measures, harm reduction, and revocation.
Although we have been emphasizing the security of the private signing key,
assurance of public key validity is highly recommended on all public keys
before using them, per [[NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1]].

        <h3>Unlinkable Disclosure</h3>

        <p>
The cryptographic suites described in this specification do not support

      <section>
        <h3>Representation: ecdsa-rdfc-2019, with curve P-256</h3>
        <p>
The signer needs to generate a private/public key pair with the private key used
for signing and the public key made available for verification. The
representation of the public key,
and the representation of the private key, are shown below.
        </p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Private and Public keys for Signature"
        data-include="TestVectors/p256KeyPair.json"
        data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <p>
Signing begins with a credential without an attached proof, which is converted
to canonical form, which is then hashed, as shown in the following three examples.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Credential without Proof" data-include="TestVectors/unsigned.json"
        data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical Credential without Proof" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-rdfc-2019-p256/canonDocECDSAP256.txt"
        data-include-format="text"></pre>


        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Hash of Canonical Credential without Proof (hex)"
        data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-rdfc-2019-p256/docHashECDSAP256.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <p>
The next step is to take the proof options document, convert it to canonical form,
and obtain its hash, as shown in the next three examples.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Proof Options Document"
        data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-rdfc-2019-p256/proofConfigECDSAP256.json" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical Proof Options Document"
        data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-rdfc-2019-p256/proofCanonECDSAP256.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Hash of Canonical Proof Options Document (hex)"
        data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-rdfc-2019-p256/proofHashECDSAP256.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <p>
Finally, we concatenate the hash of the proof options followed by the hash of the credential without proof, use the private key with the combined hash to

To demonstrate selective disclosure features we break the test vectors into two
groups based on those that would be generated by the issuer (base proof) and
those that would be generated by the holder (derived proof).
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>Base Proof</h4>
          <p>
In order to add a selective disclosure base proof to a document the issuer needs
the following cryptographic key material:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
The issuers private/public key pair, i.e., the key pair corresponding to the
verification method that will be part of the proof.
            </li>
            <li>
A per proof private/public key pair created by the issuer just for this proof.
This is an ephemeral, single use key pair where the private key is not kept
after the proof has been generated.
            </li>
            <li>
An HMAC key. This used to randomize the order of the blank node ids to avoid
potential information leakage from the blank node id ordering. This is used only
once and is shared between issuer and holder. The HMAC in this case is
functioning as a pseudorandom function (PRF).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
The key material used for generating the add base proof test vectors is shown
below. Multibase representation is use for the P-256 key pairs and the HMAC key
is given as a hexadecimal string.

Transformation of the unsigned document begins with canonicalizing the document
as shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical Document" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/addBaseDocCanon.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
To prevent possible information leakage from the ordering of the blank node ids
these are processed through a PRF, i.e., the HMAC to give the canonized HMAC
document shown below. This represents an ordered list of statements that will be
subject to mandatory and selective disclosure, i.e., it is from this list that
statements are grouped.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical HMAC Document" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/addBaseDocHMACCanon.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The above canonical document gets grouped in to mandatory and non-mandatory
statements. The final output of the selective disclosure transformation process
is shown below. Each statement is now grouped as mandatory and non-mandatory and
its index in the previous list of statements is remembered.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Add Base Transformation" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/addBaseTransform.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The next step is to create the base proof configuration and canonicalize it.
This is shown in the following two examples.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Base Proof Configuration" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/addProofConfig.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical Base Proof Configuration" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/addProofConfigCanon.txt"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
In the hashing step we compute the SHA-256 hash of the canonicalized proof
options to produce the `proofHash` and we compute the SHA-256 hash of the join of
all the mandatory nquads to produce the `mandatoryHash`. These are shown below
in hexadecimal format.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Add Base Hashes" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/addHashData.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
We compute the `baseSignature` over the concatenation of the `proofHash`,
`proofPublicKey`, and `mandatoryHash` using the issuers long term `privateKey`.
We compute the `signatures` array by signing each non-mandatory nquad using the
per `proofPrivateKey`. These signatures, the `proofPublicKey`, and
`mandatoryPointers` which are fed to the final serialization step are
shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Add Base Signing" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/addRawBaseSignatureInfo.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Finally, the values above are run through the algorithm of Section
[[[#serializebaseproofvalue]]] to produce the `proofValue` which is
used in the signed based document shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Signed Base Document" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/addSignedSDBase.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Derived Proof</h4>
          <p>
In order to create a derived proof a holder starts with a signed document
containing a base proof. The base document we will use for these test vectors is
the final example from Section [[[#base-proof]]] above. The first
step is to run the algorithm of Section [[[#parsebaseproofvalue]]] to
recover `baseSignature`, `publicKey`, `hmacKey`, `signatures`, and
`mandatoryPointers` as shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Recovered Base Signature Data" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/derivedRecoveredBaseData.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Next, the holder needs to indicate what, if anything else, they wish to reveal
to the verifiers by specifying JSON pointers for selective disclosure.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Selective Disclosure Pointers" data-include="TestVectors/employSelective.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
To produce the `revealDocument`, i.e., the unsigned document that will
eventually be signed and sent to the verifier, we append the selective pointers
to the mandatory pointers and input these combined pointers along with the
document without proof to the algorithm of Section [[[#selectjsonld]]]
to give the result shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Unsigned Reveal Document" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/derivedUnsignedReveal.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Now that we know what the revealed document looks like, we need to furnish
appropriately updated information to the verifier on which statements are
mandatory, the signatures for the selected non-mandatory statements, and the
mapping between canonical blank node ids for the reveal document and a subset of
the HMAC blank node ids. Running step 6 of the
[[[#createdisclosuredata]]] yields an abundance of information about
various statement groups relative to the original document. Below we show a
portion of the indexes for those groups.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Derived Group Indexes" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/derivedGroupIndexes.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The verifier needs to be able to aggregate and hash the mandatory statements. To
enable this we furnish them with a list of indexes of the mandatory statements
adjusted to their positions in the reveal document. In the previous example the
`combinedIndexes` show the indexes of all the original nquads (statements) that
make up the reveal document, in order. To come up with the adjusted mandatory
indexes shown below we obtain the index of each of original mandatory indexes
relative to the `combinedIndexes` as shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Adjusted Mandatory Indexes" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/derivedAdjMandatoryIndexes.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
We have to furnish the verifier with a list of signatures for those selective
statements (nquads) that are not mandatory. The original list of signatures
corresponds to every non-mandatory statement and the indexes of these in the
original document are given above. We now compute a list of adjusted signature
indexes by computing the index of each selective index in the non-mandatory
index list, ignoring any selective index not present in the list. We then use
the adjusted signature indexes to obtain the filtered signature list. These
lists are shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Filtered Signatures" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/derivedAdjSignatures.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The last important piece of disclosure data is a mapping of canonical blank node
ids to HMAC based ids, the `labelMap`, computed according to Section
[[[#createdisclosuredata]]] steps 12-14. This is shown below along with
the rest of the disclosure data minus the reveal document.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Disclosure Data" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/derivedDisclosureData.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Finally using the disclosure data above with the algorithm of Section
[[[#serializederivedproofvalue]]] we obtain the signed derived (reveal)
document shown below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Signed Derived Document" data-include="TestVectors/ecdsa-sd-2023/employ/derivedRevealDocument.json"

        <h3>Additional Example for Representation: ecdsa-sd-2023</h3>
        <p>
Here we provide an additional example of basic `ecdsa-sd-2023` processing.
To demonstrate selective disclosure features we break the test vectors into two
groups based on those that would be generated by the issuer (base proof) and
those that would be generated by the holder (derived proof).
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>Base Proof</h4>
          <p>
In order to add a selective disclosure base proof to a document the issuer needs
the following cryptographic key material:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
The issuers private/public key pair, i.e., the key pair corresponding to the
verification method that will be part of the proof.
            </li>
            <li>
A per proof private/public key pair created by the issuer just for this proof.
This is an ephemeral, single use key pair where the private key is not kept
after the proof has been generated.
            </li>
            <li>
An HMAC key. This used to randomize the order of the blank node ids to avoid
potential information leakage from the blank node id ordering. This is used only
once and is shared between issuer and holder. The HMAC in this case is
functioning as a pseudorandom function (PRF).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
The key material used for generating the add base proof test vectors is shown
below. Multibase representation is use for the P-256 key pairs and the HMAC key
is given as a hexadecimal string.
          </p>

The above canonical document gets grouped in to mandatory and non-mandatory
statements. The final output of the selective disclosure transformation process
is shown below. Each statement is now grouped as mandatory and non-mandatory and
its index in the previous list of statements is remembered.

          <p>
In the hashing step we compute the SHA-256 hash of the canonicalized proof
options to produce the `proofHash` and we compute the SHA-256 hash of the join of
all the mandatory nquads to produce the `mandatoryHash`. These are shown below
in hexadecimal format.
